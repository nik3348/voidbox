# Voidbox

This app starts a server you can use to stream from your browser and users and view the stream on an endpoint on the server.

Was trying to watch videos/movies together with friends but apps would lag and desync so I whipped this up in an hour.

## Getting started

### Starting the application

Start the application using Node:

```bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Run the server
node server

# Broadcast at localhost:4000/broadcast.html and view at localhost:4000
```

## Techologies
- WebRTC
- SocketIO
